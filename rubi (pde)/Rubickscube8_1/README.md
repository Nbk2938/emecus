This program, has a slight change respect to "rubikscube8".

- The creation of the scramble sequence is given to the user.
- He can manualy create a random sequence of moves and contemporary se the result of the scramble applied to the cube in the interface.

This program is already one of the latest versions and is made specifically to be able to solve a ribiks cube with it's hardware attached to it. I have not specified the Hardware so it's not verry useful to try to run this program. It's far better and cooler to run the programs that only require the code to work, like the Rubikscube7.pde.

But to be able to run it without the entire robot it's neccessary to have:
- a connection to an arduino via a Serial comunication
- if neccessary to correct the Serial port number in the processing IDE
- correct the Arduino specification and port in Arduino IDE
- upload the code in folder sketchIno1_1 to it
- run it and it should work
