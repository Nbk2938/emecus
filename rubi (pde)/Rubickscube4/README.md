This processing program does the following:
- creates a sketch with 3d graphics with the peasy library
- constructs a rubiks cube 3 x 3 composed of 27 cubie objects
- it does not make any animation of a rotation
- you can make it do some moves by pressing the keys on the keyboard
- at first it executes a random scramble to the cube
- after you can give it some comands:
  - to see how it resolves the cube till the pll part step by step, press the following sequence of keys in order:
    - ['q', 'w', 'Q', 'W', 'a', 'A', 'n', 'N', 'm', 'M', 's', 't']
    - in the meantime you can see what and how the cube changed after a key has been pressed
  - all cross, f2l and oll algoritms have been aded to the programm and by pressing a number from 0 to 119 and the pressing enter you'll execute one of them
  - what the following key execute:
    single movementes:
    - 'f' : F
    - 'F' : F'
    - 'b' : B
    - 'B' : B'
    - 'u' : U
    - 'U' : U'
    - 'd' : D
    - 'D' : D'
    - 'l' : L
    - 'L' : L'
    - 'r' : R
    - 'R' : R'
    single cube axis rotations:
    - 'i' : x
    - 'I' : x'
    - 'j' : y
    - 'J' : y'
    - 'k' : z
    - 'K' : z'
    
to run it:
- download the entire subdirectory "Rubickscube1"
- open it with processing IDE
- run the programm
