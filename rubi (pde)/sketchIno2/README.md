This Arduino workspace contains the last and most advanced program that i've written for my Arduino in my robot.

improvements to sketchIn1:
- instead of reading numbers in it's buffers it directly reads the bitstring send to it
- the bitstring is encoded in a Hamming code so it controls the string and creates a new bitstring without the parity digits
- The Arduino transforms the bit string in decimal numbers wich define a movement 
- each number is stored in an array. This array is then used to directly indicate to each driver wich movement needs to be made next
- the next steps are the same as in SketchIno1
