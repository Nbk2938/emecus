this program, with the hardwarare components of the robot, is the first that's able to successfully solve the real cube
it runs also if there isn't any external devices

This processing program does the following:
- creates a sketch with 3d graphics with the peasy library
- constructs a rubiks cube 3 x 3 composed of 27 cubie objects
- it does come with movement animation 
- by pressing the spacebar the programm executes a random animated algorithm to the cube
- after finisching with the scramble it'll stop
- by pressing the key 's' the programm executes the generated algorithm to solve the cube
- it counts the moves till the cube isn't solved
- it is possible to connect the Arduino and upploading to it the folder "sketchIno2" 


to run it:
- download the entire subdirectory "Rubickscube7"
- open it with processing IDE
- run the programm
