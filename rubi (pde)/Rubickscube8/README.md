This program, is the successor of the rubikscube7.

The improvements:
- is more user friendly
- you can see how much time it takes to solve the cube
- code is more readable and faster
- some comments have been added 


This program is already one of the latest versions and is made specifically to be able to solve a ribiks cube with it's hardware attached to it. I have not specified the Hardware so it's not verry useful to try to run this program. It's far better and cooler to run the programs that only require the code to work, like the Rubikscube7.pde.

But to be able to run it without the entire robot it's neccessary to have:
- a connection to an arduino via a Serial comunication
- if neccessary to correct the Serial port number in the processing IDE
- correct the Arduino specification and port in Arduino IDE
- upload the code in folder ArduinoDef2 to it
- run it and it should work
