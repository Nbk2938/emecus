This processing program does the following:

- creates a sketch with 3d graphics with the peasy library
- constructs a rubiks cube 3 x 3 composed of 27 cubie objects
- it makes movement animation 


- to see how it resolves the hole cube press spacebar to scramble: 
- right after, it will execute the solution algorithm that it has found, comleting or returning the solved state of the cube.
- it'll execute a movement count of the rotations did in the solution
 
- all the other comands of the frubiksCube4 programm ar stil available to use -> se README file

To run it:
- download the entire subdirectory "Rubickscube1"
- open it with processing IDE
- run the programm
