  - it will execute an animated random scramblle of the cube 
  - right after, it will execute the solution algorithm that it has found, comleting or returning the solved state of the cube.
  - it'll execute a movement count of the rotations did in the solution
 
- all the other comands of the rubiksCube4 programm ar stil available to use
