THIS REPOSITORY IS MADE AS AN ARCHIVE FOR MY PROJECT.
The project I'am developing is a fully automatic robot that resolves a rubiks cube.
It contains varius programms:

- in the folder rubi (pde) you'll find:
  - the finished programm is contained in the folder "RUBY8" and 
  - the progress i made to the finisched programm
  - all the "Rubi" fils are written in processing code (java) and are .pde files:
    - to look at the code just go to the file of interest
    - to look the code of a hole programm download the folder in a the programm directory 
      such as "Rubikscube3" and open the folder with processing (IDE)
  - all the "SchetchIno" files are written in arduino code and are .ino files
    - to look at the code just go to the file of interest
    - to look the code of a hole programm download the folder in a the programm directory 
      such as "sketchIno3" and open the folder with Arduino studio (IDE)
